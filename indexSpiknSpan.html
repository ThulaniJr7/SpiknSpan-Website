				<h4> Disinfectant Fogging Of Your Home Or Business </h4>
				<p> Do you need to Disinfect and Sanitize your home or building? </p>
				<p> The process of treating your home or business is quick, efficient and with minimum disruption to you, your home, shop, office or warehouse. </p>
				<p> We can treat cars, taxis, trucks, houses, offices, shops or warehouses.</p>
				<p> SpiknSpan makes use of commercial ULV fogging machines (Ultra Low Volume) to generate a cold fog mist of disinfectant to cover all surface 
				areas, for a fast and efficient treatment. </p>
				<p> Using BioSyde, A 100% Organic Hospital Grade Sanitizer that has been SABS and SANAS Approved. </p>
				<p> BioSyde works through a process of cell wall intrusion, complexation of key actions, and disruption of protein functioning to cause pathogens, 
				viruses and bacteria to die. The mixture of bioflavonoids is a vital component for the efficacy of the fogging or misting system enabling for an 
				extended period of floatation, allowing for maximum contact time and further reach, thus higher killing rates. </p>
